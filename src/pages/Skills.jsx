        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve mastered front-end technologies like React,
          JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS to create pixel-perfect, responsive
          interfaces that users love. On the back-end, I’m comfortable with
          Node.js and Express, ensuring your site runs fast and secure. I’m also
          well-versed in optimizing performance, debugging complex issues, and
          integrating APIs to add that extra functionality. Beyond the tech, I
          bring a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to delivering
          projects that are as reliable as they are beautiful.
